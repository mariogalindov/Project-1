# Project-1

Mexican Loteria is a game of chance which uses a board 
with a grid of random pictures chosen from a deck of 54 cards that 
reflects elements of mexican culture.

This project takes the traditional game and digitalize it; 
you can start the game and shout "Loteria!" once you have 
clicked on all the pictures in your board, so pay attention to the
random cards and don't miss anything.
